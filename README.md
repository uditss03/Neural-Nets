# Neural-Nets

Neural Networks are being used for machine learning and applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion detection etc. These are the two basic examples of neural network made from scratch (using numpy) in python to show how the maths concept is applied in neural networks. 

## Two examples are ->

1- Single hidden Layer Neural Network

2- Multi Layer Neural Network
